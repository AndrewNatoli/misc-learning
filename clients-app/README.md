# Clients App!

The app you've been waiting for. It's going to revolutionize EVERYTHING.

## API Implementations

Current:

- Node (Express)

Future (maybe):

- Node (Nest)
- PHP (Lumen or Symfony)

The API works with three entities: `users`, `clients`, and `contacts`.

`contacts` belong to a `client`.

A `user` is required to write to `contacts` and `clients`.

## Client implementations

Future implementations

- Web (React)
- TBD
